Work in progress. To-dos:
- Continue making it look better on mobile
- Answer the question "should I go to the gym today?" based on the # of recent check-ins (either based on static number, or a running average)
- Also look for all checkins with #gym, #running, #workout
- Expand from 7 days to past 30 days
- Include other categories
